I bought a Digilent [Arty Z7-20 board](https://store.digilentinc.com/arty-z7-apsoc-zynq-7000-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/).
It joins a large stable of FPGA and microcontroller development kits, some of them still waiting to be used.

The reason for buying this one is because I want to do some experiments with Vivado, SERDES usage (DVI/HDMI hopefully) and
the Xilinx [SDSoc](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/software-zone/sdsoc.html) environment. The board has
USB ULPI and Ethernet GMII PHY. These can be driven by the on-chip hard controllers, but I think they can also be used
by the FPGA logic. I expect the Arty Z7 to have better debugging features than, say, the Pano Logic G2, so one possibility
would be to bring up those interfaces on the Z7 and, once working, move them over to the G2.

Total case was around $250, which is pretty steep as far as hobby development kits go, but it should give me plenty of space
for whatever I project I can come up with.
